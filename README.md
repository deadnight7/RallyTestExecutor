Note : I dont provide any warranties by use of this project, 
Do not IM me in case you've found yourself in deep problems after the use of this project,

With that being said heres what this project will do - 

This project will automatically export or import tests present in an excel and upload it to Rally when provided a Rally API Key for that domain
Made in Java Swing for its frontend, and other helper libraries to automate a boring task of writing testcases in Rally.
